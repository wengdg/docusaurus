This manual provides information about the design and implementation of the RadGrad system. 

The *Introduction* section introduces the primary goals for the system.  

The *Developer Guide* section provides information on how to set up your development environment, coding standard, testing mechanisms, and other issues related to working effectively and efficiently on the RadGrad code base. 

The *Data Model* section provides documentation on RadGrad's information architecture. 

The *API* section provides a link to code-level documentation generated using JSDoc.

The *Archive* section provides links to material no longer of direct use in development.
 
Note: this manual does not include a user guide. Each deployment of RadGrad includes online user documentation in two forms: guided tours, available from the home page, and page-level documentation, available by clicking on the down-arrow in the help widget at the top of each page.
