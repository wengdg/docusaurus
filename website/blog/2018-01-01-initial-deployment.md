During Spring semester, 2018, we are deploying RadGrad into the Department of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Hawaii. 

Deployment will begin with registering all of the students taking ICS 211 and ICS 314.  This should result in approximately 200 new RadGrad users, or about half of the ICS major population. 

During Fall, 2018, we will continue registering the students in ICS 211 and ICS 314, as well as providing open registration sessions in order to enable all ICS students to participate in RadGrad.
