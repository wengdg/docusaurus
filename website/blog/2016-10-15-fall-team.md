This fall, Philip Johnson, Cam Moore, Josephine Garces, Aljon Preza, and Amy Takayesu began work on the first production release of RadGrad.

Our first significant accomplishment is an update to the organization of the project. The [RadGrad Manual](https://www.gitbook.com/book/philipmjohnson/radgrad-manual/details) is now the authoritative source for requirements, design, and documentation on the system. 

Track our progress through the [RadGrad repo](https://github.com/radgrad/radgrad).
