We are starting a pilot study of RadGrad in Fall 2017 in the Department of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Hawaii. 

During the pilot study, we hope to register at least 100 students in RadGrad, and learn about any usability issues that hinder successful use of the technology by students, faculty, and advisors.
