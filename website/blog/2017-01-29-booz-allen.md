Amy Takayesu was invited to speak at the [2017 Booz Allen Ideas Festival](http://www.boozallen.com/insights/ideas/booz-allen-ideas-festival) in Honolulu, HI.  She was the only student selected to present as part of the Ignite sessions.  

Amy presented screenshots of the beta release of RadGrad, currently planned for usability evaluation during February, 2017. Reaction was very positive and we gained some useful insight from the talk.  Many thanks to the organizers for providing us with this opportunity.
