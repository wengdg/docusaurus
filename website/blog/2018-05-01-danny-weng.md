Danny Weng, an M.S. graduate student in Information and Computer Sciences, has joined the RadGrad team. 

He will be focusing on designing analytics and interventions to better understand how students become engaged with RadGrad (and, just as importantly, how students fail to become engaged with RadGrad.)
