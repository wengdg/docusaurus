The RadGrad team for Spring, 2016 has been formed. See the [Team Page](../organization/team.html) for the members. 

We have also been hard at work on the Data Model, and an initial implementation is now available as a [Meteor package](https://atmospherejs.com/radgrad/core). 

Please contact Philip Johnson if you'd like to get involved.
